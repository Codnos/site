We're pleased to announce that starting on 1 October 2019 Codnos Ltd is now
approved to provide services as part of Crown Commercial Service's Digital Outcomes and Specialists 4.

We provide services in lots:
 - Digital Outcomes
 - Digital Specialists

You can start using our services by becoming a buyer on <a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Digital Marketplace</a>.

The process was a bit lengthy and involved a fair bit of paperwork but we are very eager to start
our new journey.

The projects that were available on the Digital Marketplace in the previous iterations of the framework were
very interesting, and some of them really challenging, so we can't wait to see what the future will bring.

Stay tuned for more info about our new projects!
