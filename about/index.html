                We are Codnos and we've been helping businesses realize their full potential since 2016.
                We believe in doing things the right way and using technological
                and methodology advances to create software that delivers on its promise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years of working for many organisations we've seen a lot of badly delivered software
                projects.
                Some of them were never delivered, leading to wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds.
                We knew that it is possible to create software that works well for its users without overpaying for
                it
                as we've been doing this for years.
                That's why we started Codnos, the company that has knowledge from personal experience of efficient
                code delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                We love creating software that does great things for our clients but we love even more
                seeing how working together helps them achieve their goals quicker, more efficiently,
                and get their organisation to the next level.

                            We work according to the best practices which help us deliver software of the
                            highest quality on agreed schedule.
                            This does require effort and time to be put in to reap all the benefits in the
                            future.
                            Sometimes the reality is that the delivery has to happen here and now or else
                            the business looses the opportunity.
                            In situations like that we remain pragmatic and make sure that delivery happens
                            with enough quality to satisfy the current need.
                            Accrued technical debt is dealt with immediately after the delivery.

                            that they use.
                            This requires a lot of dedication and focus on what is most important for them.
                            A lot of hard work goes into meeting the current business needs and ensuring
                            that the software remains
                            ready for the future changes. Our people have years of experience of
                            consistently delivering the highest
                            quality of service. Even if this sometimes requires picking up the phone in the
                            middle of the night and sorting out the issue.

                        <p>
                            Years of experience have lead us to believe that one of the worst enemies of any
                            sustainable business
                            is waste. It can creep into any organisation, big or small. It can affect any
                            aspect of it
                            and cause &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;. Our way of working reflects our
                            desire to avoid waste
                            wherever possible. From Just-In-Time analysis through avoiding defects by
                            obsessively testing the product
                            to intimate knowledge of our development tools we strive for elimination of all
                            that is unnecessary.
