      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <p>
        We are Codnos and we've been helping businesses reach their potential since 2016.
        We believe in doing things the right way and using latest technologies and processes
        to shape the future together.
        Over the years of working for many organisations we've seen the problems and challenges
        that they face and are unable to deal with. Being big and entrenched in huge number of legacy processes
        and technologies they were hardly ever able to adjust and deliver change efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
          We knew that there is a better way. That's why we started the company that provides the services
          and advice that can make these organisations overcome their issues and thrive.
          We love creating software that does great things but we love even more
          seeing how by working with our clients the software that we create together
          helps them achieve their goals quicker, in a more efficient manner,
          and allows their organisation to scale.
      </p>
      <p>
          We look forward to meeting our new clients and partners and to working with them to bring a brighter future to all of us.
      </p>
      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        Our passion of turning pure ideas into something that actually works
        and provides value for others keeps us going.
        We work with organisations of different sizes.
        Starting with big financial institutions through medium and small businesses up to individuals,
        we work with everyone by understanding their needs, creating viable plan, validating it
        and turning it into a long term, strategic and maintainable solution.
        What makes us different from other software development companies is our approach to your business.
        Not only we will work with you to understand and deliver the software that you want us to help with.
        We will become experts in your domain to work hand-in-hand to draw the path to your future and help you get there.
      </p>
