                <h3>Bespoke solution development</h3>
                <p>
                    Whether you have a well thought project or just an idea that you want to test, we're here to help.
                    Our team can help you with all the stages of software delivery. The code that we produce follows
                    best practices including SOLID, DDD, TDD, BDD, GoF Patterns, OOP, FP. It is clean, mercilessly refactored
                    and very thoroughly tested. And it does what it says on the tin.

                <h3>Transforming existing products</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you would love to be able to start over and just do it &quot;this time properly&quot;.
                    But you cannot always afford that. Is your technology stack outdated? Performance below your expectations?
                    Is it not able to scale? Are you afraid to touch it because it may break? Do not despair.
                    Our team can help you bring a new life into your neglected product.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Have you got an idea that doesn't let you sleep at night? Do you think it would revolutionize your industry?
                    But is it really something that would work? Is it even feasible?
                    Or maybe you need some help in transforming a business idea into a product. We will be delighted to offer
                    you our services.

                <p>
                    Is your code of high quality? Is it future proof? Is your software delivery team doing a good job?
                    Are they following the best practices? Is there something they could do better?
                    Can your software support your organisation well when it grows? We can help you answer all of those questions.

                <p>
                    If your code is running on JVM then we're the experts that you want to have working on it.
                    We've got intimate knowledge of the JVM and have worked extensively in languages like:
                    Java, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy.

                    Maybe you're using vanilla JavaScript in your HTML code? Or do you want to go a step further
                    and start using TypeScript? We can help!

                <h3>Deployment automation</h3>
                <p>
                    Are you wondering if your releases could be less problematic and much shorter?
                    You could avoid all those unnecessarily long hours going step by step through a badly written
                    document and just have one-click-deployment. We've automated deployments of many systems
                    using tools like Ansible and Puppet.

                <h3>Continuous delivery</h3>
                <p>
                    Why not go a step further in your automation and always be ready to ship your software?
                    By including all the best practices and processes you can get your software into a state
                    where only minutes are needed from writing your software to deployment to production.

                <h3>Agile delivery</h3>
                <p>
                    The full lifecycle of software creation can be a very complicated and time consuming process.
                    We have seen many companies waste a lot of time and money on doing unnecessary rituals
                    and documents that did not benefit anyone. We use lightweight, well tailored processes
                    that make sure that we deliver what you need when you need it.
                </p>

                <h3>Micro-Service architectures</h3>
                <p>
                    New trends in software creation allow better modularisation and independent, safe
                    deployments of logical units of functionality. They also allow scaling your system
                    and isolating it from the failures of other components. If you're looking
                    to transform your application from monolithic architecture to micro-services,
                    we're the people who can get you there.

                <h3>Reactive Functional Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    With Moore's Law reaching its limits we can no longer rely on increasing
                    the power of CPUs to make our applications run faster or be able to handle more users.
                    We have to instead become smarter about how we write the code to use the parallel processing
                    power of modern multi-core processors. Using immutable data structures, pure functions,
                    lock-free algorithms and reactive streaming with back-pressure allows maximizing the benefits
                    of modern day parallel computing. Get ready for the future of high performance computing.
                </p>

                <h3>Distributed computing</h3>
                <p>
                    Some problems are easy and can be solved in milliseconds on one machine,
                    some need hours on a single machine. But when split into small, independent units of work
                    and run on a cluster of thousands of machines they can deliver the result in seconds.
                    If you believe your application has reached its performance limits but you demand more,
                    please ask us for advice on how to push it to the limits.
