                <p>
                    We are Codnos and we've been helping businesses realize their full potential since 2016.
                    We believe in doing things the right way and using technological
                    and methodology advances to create software that delivers on its promise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years of working for many organisations we've seen a lot of badly delivered software
                    projects.
                    Some of them were never delivered, leading to wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds.
                    We knew that it is possible to create software that works well for its users without overpaying for
                    it
                    as we've been doing this for years.
                    That's why we started Codnos, the company that has knowledge from personal experience of efficient
                    code delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We love creating software that does great things for our clients but we love even more
                    seeing how working together helps them achieve their goals quicker, more efficiently,
                    and get their organisation to the next level.
                </p>
                <h2>mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Our passion of turning pure ideas into something that actually works and provides value is what
                    drives us.
                    We want to help our customers understand their needs, create viable plan, validate it and turn it
                    into a long term, strategic and future-proof solution.
                    A lot of companies try to do that. What makes us different is our approach to your business.
                    Not only we work with you to understand and deliver the software that you want us to help with.
                    We become experts in your domain who can help you grow your business much further than software
                    itself would.
                </p>

                                We work according to the best practices which help us deliver software of the
                                highest quality on agreed schedule.
                                This does require effort and time to be put in to reap all the benefits in the
                                future.
                                Sometimes the reality is that the delivery has to happen here and now or else
                                the business looses the opportunity.
                                In situations like that we remain pragmatic and make sure that delivery happens
                                with enough quality to satisfy the current need.
                                Accrued technical debt is dealt with immediately after the delivery.

                                Our priority is making sure that our customers are satisfied with the software

                                This requires a lot of dedication and focus on what is most important for them.
                                A lot of hard work goes into meeting the current business needs and ensuring
                                that the software remains
                                ready for the future changes. Our people have years of experience of
                                consistently delivering the highest
                                quality of service. Even if this sometimes requires picking up the phone in the

                                Years of experience have lead us to believe that one of the worst enemies of any
                                sustainable business
                                is waste. It can creep into any organisation, big or small. It can affect any
                                aspect of it
                                and cause &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;. Our way of working reflects our
                                desire to avoid waste
                                wherever possible. From Just-In-Time analysis through avoiding defects by
                                obsessively testing the product
                                to intimate knowledge of our development tools we strive for elimination of all
                                that is unnecessary.
