                            When writing software we create testing strategy
                            and automate test suite for all levels and types of testing:
                            Unit, Integration, System,
                            Acceptance, UAT, Regression and Performance.
                            And then make sure that these test are continuously testing the software.
                            On every change.

                        <p>
                            When preparing releases of the code we make sure that they are less problematic and much shorter.
                            We avoid all those unnecessarily long hours going step by step through a badly
                            written document and just have one-click-deployment. We've automated deployments of many systems
                            using tools like Ansible and Puppet.

                            We always go a step further in automation and are always ready to ship the software.
                            By including all the best practices and processes we get software into a state
                            where only minutes separate us from writing code to deploying it into production.

                            Writing software and handing it over to someone else does not work.
                            We've seen it many times before. To make sure that the software is easy to support
                            we take on the pain of supporting it throughout all the stages of the lifecycle.
                            We write it, deploy, monitor and fix any issues that escaped into production.

                            to transform your application from monolithic architecture to micro-services,
                            we're the people who can get you there.

                            With Moore's Law reaching its limits we can no longer rely on increasing
                            the power of CPUs to make our applications run faster or be able to handle more users.
                            We have to instead become smarter about how we write the code to use the parallel
                            processing
                            power of modern multi-core processors. Using immutable data structures, pure functions,
                            lock-free algorithms and reactive streaming with back-pressure allows maximizing the
                            benefits
                            of modern day parallel computing.
                            We will help you benefit from the future of high performance computing.
